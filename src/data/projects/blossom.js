    Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers, Blossom allows you to click or tap to
    create an ever-evolving music and color experience. It enables anyone
    to create beautiful ambient music inside their browser. Also inlcuded
    is an endless self-playing functionality, with which one can either
    play along or simply watch and enjoy.`,
