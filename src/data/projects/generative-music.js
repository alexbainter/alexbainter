  description: `A collection of generative music pieces which can be played right
    in your browser. Every performance is unique and never repeats,
    and yet the music lasts as long as you're willing to listen. Even though you'll
    never hear the same thing twice, each performance of a piece is unmistakably
    familiar. I find the music is perfect for listening to during activities which
    require concentration, like reading, writing, or working.`,
