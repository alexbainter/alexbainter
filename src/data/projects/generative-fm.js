  description: `This project is both a collection of generative music systems and a platform for playing and recording said systems.
    Every performance is unique and never repeats, and yet the music lasts as long
    as you're willing to listen. Many users find the music is perfect for listening to during activities which
    require concentration, like reading, writing, or working.`,
