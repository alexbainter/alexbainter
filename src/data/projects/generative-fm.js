  description: `A platform for generative music pieces played in the browser.
    In addition to the site itself, I create and maintain the generative music systems
    currently featured on it. Every performance is unique and never repeats, and yet the music lasts as long
    as you're willing to listen. Even though you'll never hear the same thing twice,
    each performance of a piece is unmistakably familiar. Many users find the music is perfect for listening to during activities which
    require concentration, like reading, writing, or working.`,
